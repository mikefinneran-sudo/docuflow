# DocuFlow Intelligence
## Granola-Inspired Document Intelligence Features

**Status:** Backlog
**Created:** 2025-10-24
**Inspiration:** granola.ai ($250M valuation)
**Goal:** Build "Granola for Documents"

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Transform DocuFlow from a document management system into a document intelligence platform by implementing granola.ai's winning approach for documents instead of meetings.

**Core Value Proposition:**
Turn any document into actionable intelligence with AI-powered templates, automatic action extraction, and conversational document queries.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Smart Document Templates
Pre-built templates for common document types with automatic field extraction:
- Contracts (parties, dates, payment terms, deliverables)
- Proposals (scope, pricing, timeline, next steps)
- Project Plans (milestones, owners, deadlines)
- Reports (KPIs, decisions, action items)

### 2. Automatic Action Extraction
AI-powered detection of action items, deadlines, and owners from any document:
- Action dashboard (overdue, this week, this month)
- Email/Slack reminders
- Cross-document action tracking

### 3. Document @ Mention System
Chat interface with document context:
```
"What are payment terms from @acme-agreement?"
"Compare pricing between @proposal-a and @proposal-b"
"Show all actions from @project-plan"
```

### 4. AI Processing Pipeline
- Auto-detect document type
- Extract structured metadata
- Generate executive summaries
- Find document relationships

### 5. Document Intelligence Chat
Conversational interface for document queries and drafting.
