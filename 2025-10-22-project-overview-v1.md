- Batch processing of folders
- Quick search across all departments
- Working → Final → Archive workflow

### 2. Version Control
**Problem:** No way to recover previous versions, "final_v2_FINAL_revised.docx" chaos

**Solution:**
- Automatic version snapshots
- Keep last 5 versions (configurable)
- Full metadata tracking
- One-click restore to any version
- File integrity verification

### 3. Retention Policy
**Problem:** Old files pile up forever, compliance risks, wasted storage

**Solution:**
- Auto-archive files after 30 days (configurable)
- Auto-delete after 180 days (configurable)
- Compliance reporting
- Mark important files for permanent retention
- Dry-run mode before making changes

### 4. Alert System
**Problem:** Files get deleted without warning, no visibility into what's expiring

**Solution:**
- Email/Slack alerts 7 days before deletion
- Weekly retention reports
- Expiration warnings
- Test mode for configuration
