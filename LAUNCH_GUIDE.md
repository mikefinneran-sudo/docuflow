## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Launch
```bash
# Test Python version
python3 --version
# Should be 3.7 or higher

# Test tkinter installation
python3 -c "import tkinter; print('Tkinter OK')"
```

### Permission Errors
- Check folder permissions
- Ensure write access to base_path directory
- Run with appropriate user permissions

### Import Errors
- Ensure all 6 Python files are in same directory
- Check config.json exists
- Verify Python 3.7+ is installed

## Next Steps

1. **Customize** config.json for your first client
2. **Test** with sample files to verify operation
3. **Deploy** to client system
