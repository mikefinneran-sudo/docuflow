## Unit Economics

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions:**
- Average customer lifetime: 36 months
- Average monthly revenue: $166
- Gross margin: 90%

**LTV Calculation:**
```
LTV = (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin × Average Lifetime) + Setup Fee

Basic Tier:
LTV = ($99 × 0.90 × 36) + $500 = $3,208 + $500 = $3,708

Professional Tier:
LTV = ($199 × 0.90 × 36) + $1,000 = $6,452 + $1,000 = $7,452

Enterprise Tier:
LTV = ($299 × 0.90 × 36) + $1,500 = $9,698 + $1,500 = $11,198

Blended Average LTV = $5,988
```

### LTV:CAC Ratio

```
LTV:CAC = $5,988 / $150 = 39.9:1
```

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: >3:1
- Good: 3:1
- Poor: <1:1

**DocuFlow Score: 40:1 (Excellent)**

### Payback Period

```
Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin)
Payback Period = $150 / ($166 × 0.90) = 1.0 months
```

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: <12 months
- Good: 12-18 months
- Poor: >18 months

**DocuFlow Score: 1 month (Excellent)**

## Break-Even Analysis

### Fixed vs Variable Costs

**Fixed Costs (Monthly):**
- Infrastructure: $60
- Labor (minimum): $200 (founder doing everything)
- **Total Fixed: $260/month**

**Variable Costs (Per Customer):**
- Onboarding labor: $200 (one-time)
- Monthly maintenance: $20
- Support: $10
- Payment processing: ~$5 (3% of $166)
- **Total Variable: $35/month per customer**

### Break-Even Calculation

```
Break-even (customers) = Fixed Costs / (Monthly Revenue - Variable Costs)
Break-even = $260 / ($166 - $35)
Break-even = $260 / $131
Break-even = 2 customers (monthly)
```

**To cover ALL Year 1 costs:**
```
Total Year 1 costs = $87,600
Average revenue per customer (Year 1) = $1,695
Break-even = $87,600 / $1,695
Break-even = 52 customers
```

**Timeline to Break-Even:**
- Monthly cash flow positive: Month 1 (2+ customers)
- Cumulative profit positive: Month 5 (52 customers)
