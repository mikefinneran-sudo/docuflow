## 🛡️ SAFETY FEATURES (Client Confidence)

### **100% Reversible - Nothing Permanent**

DocuFlow is designed with client safety as the top priority. Every operation can be reversed.

#### ✅ **Non-Destructive Operations**
- **Files are COPIED, not moved** - Original files remain untouched during organization
- **Versions are full copies** - Never overwrites originals
- **Archive is just a folder** - Files aren't deleted, just moved
- **Dry-run mode available** - Preview changes before applying

#### ✅ **Multiple Safety Layers**

**Layer 1: Original Files Preserved**
- When organizing: Original file stays in place, copy created in organized location
- Option to move instead of copy (but copy is default)
- User must explicitly confirm moves/deletes

**Layer 2: Version Control**
- Automatic snapshots before any change
- Keep last 5 versions of every file (configurable)
- One-click restore to any previous version
- Full metadata: who changed, when, what

**Layer 3: Dry-Run Mode**
- Preview what will happen before it happens
- See exactly which files will be archived/deleted
- No changes until you confirm

**Layer 4: Retention Warnings**
- 7-day warning before deletion (configurable)
- Email/Slack alerts
- Mark files for permanent retention
- Undo retention enforcement

**Layer 5: Complete Audit Trail**
- Every action logged with timestamp
- Track what was changed, when, by whom
- Searchable log files
- Export logs for compliance

#### ✅ **Easy Rollback Features**

| Feature | Reversibility | How to Undo |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **File Organization** | 100% | Files are copied; originals untouched; or delete organized copy |
| **Batch Organization** | 100% | Delete entire organized folder; originals remain |
| **Version Creation** | 100% | Restore previous version from versions/ folder |
| **Archive Files** | 100% | Move back from Archive/ to Working/ |
| **Delete Files** | 95%* | Restore from versions/ (if version control enabled) |
| **Retention Policy** | 100% | Dry-run mode; manual review before deletion |

*Files deleted via retention policy can be restored from versions/ folder if version control was enabled. We recommend keeping versions for 2x the retention period.
