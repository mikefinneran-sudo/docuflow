# DocuFlow Safety Guarantee

## 100% Reversible - Zero Risk Installation

**We guarantee that DocuFlow will never permanently delete or corrupt your files.**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 5-Layer Safety System

### **Layer 1: Non-Destructive by Default**

**Your original files are NEVER touched:**
- When organizing files, DocuFlow **COPIES** them (doesn't move)
- Your original files stay exactly where they are
- You can delete the organized copies anytime
- Original folder structure preserved

**Example:**
```
BEFORE DocuFlow:
Downloads/invoice.pdf ‚Üê Original stays here

AFTER DocuFlow:
Downloads/invoice.pdf ‚Üê Still here, untouched
Documents/Finance/Working/AcmeCorp_Invoice_20251022_v1.pdf ‚Üê New organized copy
```

### **Layer 2: Version Control**

**Every file change is backed up:**
- Before DocuFlow modifies ANY file, it creates a version snapshot
- Keeps last 5 versions of every file (configurable to keep more)
- One-click restore to any previous version
- Even deleted files can be recovered (from version history)

**Example:**
```
You edit Contract.docx:
1. DocuFlow auto-creates: versions/Contract.docx.20251022_100530
2. You can now safely edit the file
3. Made a mistake? Restore the version with 1 click
```

### **Layer 3: Dry-Run Mode**

**Preview BEFORE making changes:**
- See exactly what will happen before it happens
- Review the list of files to be archived
- Review the list of files to be deleted
- Nothing changes until you approve
- Cancel anytime

**Example:**
```
python docuflow.py
‚Üí Choose: 10. Run retention enforcement (dry run)

Output:
[DRY RUN] Would archive: OldReport.pdf (35 days old)
[DRY RUN] Would delete: VeryOldFile.pdf (185 days old)

Nothing actually happened. Review and approve or cancel.
```

### **Layer 4: Retention Warnings**

**7-day warning before any file is deleted:**
- Email/Slack alert: "These files will be deleted in 7 days"
- Review the list and mark important files for retention
- Files marked for retention are NEVER deleted
- You control what gets deleted, not the system

**Example:**
```
Email Alert (7 days before deletion):

‚ö†Ô∏è Document Disposal Alert

The following files will be deleted on October 29, 2025:

1. OldContract.pdf (Finance/Archive/)
   ‚Üí Click here to mark for retention

2. 2024Budget.xlsx (Finance/Archive/)
   ‚Üí Click here to mark for retention

Action Required: Review and mark important files.
```

### **Layer 5: Complete Audit Trail**

**Every action is logged:**
- What was changed
- When it was changed
- Who changed it
- Why it was changed
- How to undo it

**Example Log:**
```
2025-10-22 14:30:15 | Organized: Downloads/invoice.pdf ‚Üí Documents/Finance/Working/Invoice_v1.pdf
2025-10-22 14:31:20 | Created version: Contract.docx.20251022_143120
2025-10-22 15:00:00 | Archived: OldReport.pdf ‚Üí Archive/OldReport.pdf
2025-10-22 15:00:05 | Deleted (retention expired): VeryOldFile.pdf
```

## üö´ What DocuFlow CAN'T Do (By Design)

**DocuFlow cannot:**
- ‚ùå Delete your original files (without explicit confirmation)
- ‚ùå Modify files without creating a version first
- ‚ùå Access files outside the configured folders
- ‚ùå Bypass your operating system permissions
- ‚ùå Delete files without warning (7-day alert first)
- ‚ùå Make irreversible changes in dry-run mode
- ‚ùå Automatically overwrite files (versions instead)

---

## üß™ Test It Yourself (Risk-Free)

### **30-Second Safety Test**

**Step 1: Create a test folder**
```bash
mkdir ~/DocuFlow_Test
echo "Test file" > ~/DocuFlow_Test/test.txt
```

**Step 2: Organize the test file**
```bash
python3 docuflow.py
‚Üí Choose: 2. Organize single file
‚Üí File: ~/DocuFlow_Test/test.txt
‚Üí Department: Finance
```

**Step 3: Verify original is untouched**
```bash
ls ~/DocuFlow_Test/test.txt
# File still exists!
```

**Step 4: Check organized copy**
```bash
ls Documents/Finance/Working/
# See your organized copy here
```

**Step 5: Delete everything (undo test)**
```bash
rm -rf Documents/Finance/
# Organized copy deleted; original still in ~/DocuFlow_Test/
```

**Result:** Original file never touched. 100% safe.

1. **Check retention log**
   ```bash
   cat retention_log.txt
   # See list of everything deleted
   ```

2. **Restore from versions**
   ```bash
   # All deleted files have versions (if versioning enabled)
   ls versions/
   ```

3. **Mark important files for retention**
